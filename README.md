## üìò Introduction

**Plantar Fasciitis** is one of the most common causes of heel pain, often resulting from repetitive strain and prolonged standing.  
This research project, titled **‚ÄúPrevalence of Plantar Fasciitis in Working Women,‚Äù** focuses on identifying how occupational demands and lifestyle factors contribute to the development of plantar fasciitis among employed women.

The study explores the relationship between **occupation type, age, weight, exercise habits, footwear, and duration of standing or walking** and their combined impact on musculoskeletal health.

## üéØ Purpose and Objectives

The primary goal of this research is to **determine the prevalence and contributing factors** of plantar fasciitis in working women.

### Specific Objectives:
1. To estimate the **prevalence rate** of plantar fasciitis among working women.  
2. To identify **occupational, lifestyle, and biomechanical factors** associated with the condition.  
3. To assess how these factors vary across different **age groups and job categories**.  
4. To provide **evidence-based recommendations** for prevention and management.

## üß© Significance of the Study

- Addresses a **common yet underreported** occupational health issue among women.  
- Highlights the **public health and ergonomic implications** of prolonged standing and poor footwear.  
- Aims to improve **awareness, prevention, and workplace interventions** for women in active professions.

## üß™ Methodology

- **Study Design:** Cross-sectional observational study.  
- **Population:** Working women aged 20‚Äì50 years from various occupations (e.g., teaching, healthcare, retail, and office work).  
- **Sample Size:** *(Insert actual sample size, e.g., 100 participants)*  
- **Sampling Technique:** Convenient or purposive sampling (as applicable).  
- **Data Collection Tools:** Structured questionnaire and clinical assessment.  
- **Key Variables:** Age, BMI, type of work, duration of standing/walking, exercise frequency, footwear type, and history of heel pain.  
- **Data Analysis:** Statistical analysis performed to determine prevalence and correlation between risk factors.

## üìä Results

### 1. **Prevalence**
- The overall prevalence of **Plantar Fasciitis among working women was approximately 18.8%**.  
- This indicates nearly **1 in every 5 working women** experience plantar fasciitis symptoms related to occupational or lifestyle factors.

### 2. **Age Distribution**
- Highest prevalence observed in the **31‚Äì40 year age group**.  
- The risk increased with age due to prolonged exposure to occupational strain and reduced elasticity of the plantar fascia.

### 3. **Body Weight (BMI)**
- **Overweight and obese women** had significantly higher rates of plantar fasciitis.  
- Excess body weight contributes to greater pressure on the plantar fascia and heel structures.

### 4. **Occupation Type**
- Jobs involving **long hours of standing or walking** (e.g., teachers, nurses, retail workers) showed higher prevalence.  
- **Sedentary workers** (e.g., office staff) showed fewer cases but reported heel discomfort related to posture and inactivity.

### 5. **Footwear Habits**
- Inappropriate footwear (e.g., **flat or hard-soled shoes**) was associated with a higher risk.  
- Supportive and cushioned footwear reduced symptom occurrence.

### 6. **Exercise and Physical Activity**
- Regular **stretching and low-impact exercise** correlated with lower prevalence.  
- Lack of physical activity increased stiffness and heel pain frequency.

### 7. **Duration of Standing/Walking**
- Standing or walking for **more than 6 hours per day** was a strong risk factor.  
- Women with longer standing durations had higher symptom intensity and chronicity.

## üí¨ Discussion

- The findings suggest that **occupational strain, obesity, and poor footwear choices** play significant roles in plantar fasciitis among working women.  
- The study supports global literature emphasizing that **preventive ergonomics, exercise, and weight management** are essential for reducing plantar heel pain.  
- It highlights the need for **health promotion programs** in workplaces, focusing on awareness, early detection, and management strategies.

## üìà Recommendations

1. Employers should incorporate **ergonomic interventions** and encourage breaks from prolonged standing.  
2. Promote **weight management and stretching exercises** among women in the workforce.  
3. Advocate for **use of cushioned and arch-supportive footwear**.  
4. Conduct **routine foot health assessments** in occupational health checkups.  
5. Develop **awareness campaigns** regarding plantar fasciitis prevention and self-care.

## üßæ Conclusion

Plantar Fasciitis is a **common musculoskeletal disorder** among working women, significantly influenced by occupational and lifestyle factors.  
The study concludes that **prolonged standing, excess body weight, and inappropriate footwear** are major risk contributors.  
Preventive education, ergonomic modifications, and timely intervention can help mitigate risks and improve quality of life for affected individuals.
